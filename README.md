# Nursetec-Report-and-Managment-System

This application was, and is being developed, as an internal management system for NursetecSA.
The intent thereof, was to create an all-in-one platform where everyone from low level employees to high level managers and directors can access information and statistics about internal employees activities respectively.

For Employees:
The solution provides a means for easy leave calculation and application, so that users never need to contact an HR department or their direct managers to apply for leave, and so that they can monitor and keep track of their leave on a required basis.

For Managers:
The application not only aim to provide employees with management of their own leave and employment statistics, but also managers with access to employee leave applications for approval or denial, as well as reports on the userâ€™s attendance records. i.e Hours worked, break times, number of breaks, days absent (without official leave), days on leave, time of arrivals (with flags on late arrivals and early leave) etc.

Overall, the goal is to streamline the internal communication for things like leave applications, to prevent loss of data and possibly incorrect data capturing, as well as keep track of employees and employees attendance minimizing time theft to the company.
